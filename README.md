# Ford GoBike System Data Analysis
## by Sandra Kamikazi


## Dataset

Data collected for the bike-sharing service in the greater San Francisco Bay area includes information on each ride.
The Bay Area Bike Share model of the Ford GoBike was first made available in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2013. It was later resurrected as the Ford GoBike. In addition, the system has been known as Bay Wheels since June 2019. The three Bay Wheels pricing tiers are contained in the dataset. Additionally, there are two payment options: paying per trip as a non-user or paying on a monthly or annual subscription basis for Bike Share for All.

The dataset has 174952 rows and 13 columns after some data processing. There are several structured data types for the attributes. There are absolutely no missing values. The critical variables I concentrated on were time and gender, and data cleaning was done to manage the dataset better.


## Summary of Findings

While subscribers often use them to commute to work or school, learned from the research that customers are more likely to be tourists, vacationers, or infrequent users. Second, the regular hours were changed to 7 am and 7 pm due to subscribers' much higher user base. It would be amazing to observe the variations if research on use length were done. Thirdly, customer excursions on bikes typically last longer than ones taken by subscribers. Fourth, around 90.5% of the journeys were made by subscribers. Not to mention, more than 75% of users are men.


## Key Insights for Presentation

My presentation was focused on the organized steps I took to gather the data for my dataset. First, I introduced my dataset and its importance by exhibiting and describing it. Then I started with various cleaning-related tasks, incorporating elements that helped my analysis, such as the days of the week, into the process. Then I started presenting the findings of my research.

I employed various strategies in my research to address particular questions I had for myself, such as what proportions of men and women rent bikes? In order to react to these questions, I used visualizations like donut charts and histograms.
